## Unpacking

Upon arrival, carefully remove all paper surrounding your leaves and cut out of the plastic baggie holding the dirt in and replace any dirt that has fallen out of the bag. Water, if needed, and acclimate your plant to the light. Your plant has been on a long journey in the hands of people who do not care about it as we do, so it may need a day or two to perk back up. However, if you have any issues with your order at all or your package arrives damaged, please message me and let me know so we can start working towards a resolution right away. 

## Syngonium Care

Dwarf Syngoniums are cared for in the same manner as the larger version, however you may have to water them slightly more often because smaller pots will make the plant dry out faster. Water by soaking the soil then allowing the soil to almost dry before watering again. Fertilize once or twice a month all year. 

Syngoniums want bright indirect sunlight and could be burned if they are left out in direct sun. This is a semi-tropical plant that can be outside until temperatures dip below 60 degrees F. Plants like to be somewhat rootbound, however these plants will also spread, growing new rhizomes. Increase the size of your pot as the plant spreads, or divide to keep the patch small and increase the number of plants you have. Just make sure you have both some root and rhizome on all parts, breaking up at places that look like a natural spot to divide, to give the greatest chance of success.

In addition to division, you can propagate by cuttings. Simply look into the plants near the bottom for nodes. These sometimes already have aerial roots poking out from them.Simply cut below the node and root in water or soil.
