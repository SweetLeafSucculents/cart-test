Dwarf Syngoniums are cared for in the same manner as the larger version, however you may have to water them slightly more often because smaller pots will make the plant dry out faster. Water by soaking the soil then allowing the soil to almost dry before watering again. Fertilize once or twice a month all year. 

Syngoniums want bright indirect sunlight and could be burned if they are left out in direct sun. This is a semi-tropical plant that can be outside until temperatures dip below 60 degrees F. Plants like to be somewhat rootbound, however these plants will also spread, growing new rhizomes. Increase the size of your pot as the plant spreads, or divide to keep the patch small and increase the number of plants you have. Just make sure you have both some root and rhizome on all parts, breaking up at places that look like a natural spot to divide, to give the greatest chance of success. Another way to propagate is to take leaf cuttings at the bottom of the stem where there is a growth node. Clip under the node with a sterile knife or blade and then plant in soil that is kept moist or water propagated. 

When leaves die, do NOT remove the whole stem until it has completely died. These are top heading plants. When leaves die, wait to remove the stem until it dies all the way to the bottom. New leaves come out of the old stems, so if the new leaf has not come out yet, clipping the stem too early will cause thinning.
