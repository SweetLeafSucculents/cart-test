Your nepenthes kokedama was made to order and your plant is growing in the correct medium. Nepenthes kokedamas contain no soil and the moss ball is completely comprised of long fiber sphagnum moss, alone. You plant can remain this way until the roots grow out of the ball or until you feel that it is ready to be moved to a pot. 

If you would like to put your nepenthes in a pot once it begins to grow out of the kokedama you can cut off the twine, wrap the ball in more long fiber sphagnum moss and then simply put it in a plastic pot. Potted Nepenthes should be repotted every two years, so you will want to change the moss on your order two years from when initially arrived so that the moss is not too old and degraded. 

When this time comes, gently wrap the roots in pure long fiber sphagnum moss or a 50/50 mixture of long fiber sphagnum moss and perlite. Be gentle with the roots as Nepenthes roots are very delicate. 

To water, place Kokedama in a dish and then fill the dish with distilled, reverse osmosis or clean collected rainwater and allow the kokedama to soak for 10 to 15 minutes or until the moss ball is thoroughly watered. Then remove kokedama and gently squeeze out the excess water and then hang or return to a dish. Kokedama should not be allowed to dry out and should be soaked every few days when it begins to feel like and dry.
