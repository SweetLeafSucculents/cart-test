## Unpacking

When plant arrives: Carefully remove from box and cut out of bag. Remove any paper or packaging material gently, as it will be packed between leaves to prevent crushing. Water thoroughly with rain, distilled or reverse osmosis water. Your plant has been on a long journey and it has delicate leaves. While we try everything we can to ensure that your plant does not get damaged when shipping, the carriers do not care as much about your package as you or I do. When you open it there may be some damage to the delicate leaves, however it is a fast grower and will be popping out new leaves in no time! If there is extreme damage that the plant will not recover from, please contact me with photos within 24 hours. 

## Caring for your Calathea Zebrina from Sweet Leaf!

Calathea zebrina (the Zebra Plant) is a fast grower that should be transplanted when needed. From time to time outer leaves will die. Prune them as new leaves grow in.

This species likes to be indoors if it is below 61 degrees F. These plants prefer indirect light and will NOT do well in full sun. Soil should be kept moist in Summer and does not like to dry out. Plants enjoy a shower with lukewarm water when possible, however, Calatheas do not particularly care for tap water. If possible, always water with reverse osmosis water, distilled water or collected rain. If unavailable, putting water out on the counter the night before to let the chlorine escape is best. Fertilize twice a month during the growing season from Spring to Fall. NO fertilizer in Winter. Misting or placing on a tray of rocks and water is also beneficial, as this plant like humid surroundings. However, do not leave the plant in standing water that is high enough to rot the roots. 

Non-Toxic. Fuzzy pet and reptile safe.
