'Mini Pink' Fittonia - The Nerve Plant - is covered in beautiful colored veins over green leaves coordinating with the color listed. If you are looking for a different color, please check our other listings as we currently carry 'Red,' 'White,' and 'Pink.' Nerve plants come POTTED in a 2" plastic nursery pot or 2.5" terra cotta pot for an additional charge and can grow to be 6" to 12" inches tall with leaves that are 1 - 2" long with tiny yellow flowers on growths that shoot up from the centers. Pinching off shoots that grow leggy will encourage plant to grow bushier and more full. Great plant for terrariums and fairy gardens, as house plants or as bedding, or can be put in a hanging planter and allowed to trail.

Cold hardy year round in Zones 10 to 11. This species likes to be indoors when temperatures dip below 50 degrees F. Normal room temperature inside is ideal. Easy to grow, these plants like shade to partial shade and enjoy low to medium light.
