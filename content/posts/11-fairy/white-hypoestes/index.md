White color Hypoestes phyllostachya - The Polka Dot Plant is covered in beautiful colored splotches coordinating with the color listed. If you are looking for a different color, please check our other listings as we currently carry 'Red,' 'White,' 'Pink,' 'Rose,' and this Mix of all four. Polka Dot plants come POTTED in a 2.25" plastic nursery pot or 2.5" terra cotta pot for an additional charge and can grow to be 12" to 20" inches tall. Pinching off shoots that grow 12 to 15" will encourage plant to grow bushier and more full. Great plant for terrariums and fairy gardens, as house plants or as bedding.

Cold hardy year round in Zones 10 to 11. This species likes to be indoors when temperatures dip below 61 degrees F. Normal room temperature inside is ideal. Easy to grow, these plants like bright indirect light, but lack of light can cause the plant to lose their splotches and develop solid green leaves. If your plant seems to be reducing the amount of colored splotches, it can be placed in full sun a few hours a day in early morning, or after the sun is most harsh during the day.
